** NOTE **
If you like this project, check out http://github.com/rupa/z
a complete rethink that the author is now using.
If you are a python person and interested in experimenting with stuff, 
http://github.com/rupa/j2 is similar to z, uses python to make experimentation 
somewhat easier (for me at least), but is not really maintained or indented for
everyday use.
**********

maintains a jump-list of the directories you actually use
old directories eventually fall off the list
inspired by Joel Schaerer's http://wiki.github.com/joelthelion/autojump
and something similar i had - but i could never get the dir list right.

INSTALL:
  source into .bashrc under your '[-z "$PS1" ] || return' line
  cd around for a while

USE:
  j [--h[elp]] [--l] [--r] [--s] [regex1 ... regexn]
                      with no args, returns full list (same as j --l)
    regex1 ... regexn jump to the the weighted directory matching all masks
    --l               show the list instead of jumping
    --r               order by recently used instead of most used.
    --s               shortest matching path

TIPS:
  Some handy aliases:
    alias jl='j --l'
    alias jr='j --r'
    alias js='j --s'
